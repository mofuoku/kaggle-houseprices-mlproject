# Kaggle-House-Prices Machine Learning Project

## Code for exploring house prices dataset and making predictions for submission on Kaggle
### Goal of the project
Many factors determine the price a buyer is prepared to pay for a house. Some are discernable, and some are not. Nonetheless, a methodical approach expedited by machine learning can be advantageous 
in predicting the house price. The dataset for this project has 79 explanatory variables with their prices 
describing virtually every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. You are challenged to discover a 
relationship between the essential features and the price and apply it to predict the final price of each home.
